Analysis__

Which bikes have been used the most? Which bikes should be due for repair?__
  For the sample selected, the bikes generally have very similar usage metrics. One bike (ID 42266), however, had significantly more
  distance travelled than the others, as well as a higher number of trips than any other bike (by a smaller margin).
  
What age of customers travel the furthest distance on their trips? What age takes the most bike rides?__
  As far as trip duration goes, 18 year-olds spend the highest amount of time on their bike rides, but they also had a below-average
  amount of distance travelled. This could suggest that either there was a small sample size for 18 year-olds, or that 18 year-olds 
  travel slower or stop more frequently on their bikes. The ages with the highest median distance traveled are 19, 21, 61 and 70.
  One metric of note is that there is an extraordinary decrease in distance traveled between 21 and 22 year-olds, but it is possible
  that this could also be attributed to the sample size.
  
COVID-19 Pandemic's Effect on CitiBike__
  This is an extra (and basic) visualization, but given the timeframe that the data is from (March 2020) it felt necessary. The
  state of New York declared an emergency for the pandemic on March 7th. After March 7th, the amount of rides in the city spikes,
  before taking a nosedive on March 9th. After March 9th the amount of rides was consistently less than the amount of rides on 
  earlier dates.
